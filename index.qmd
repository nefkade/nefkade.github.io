My name is Kade Nef. I am a Senior at Brigham Young University - Idaho. I am originally from Idaho Falls, Idaho. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, playing disc golf, and spending time with my family.

Featured on this site is some of my work. Most of it has been kept generic for privacy. I hope to highligh my skills in the following areas:

 - Data Wrangling
    - Using different methods including pandas and tidyverse
 - Data Visualization
    - Using ggplot, seaborn, plotly, and much more
 - SQL Data Querying
 - Machine Learning

 Thank you for taking your time to check out some of my work.
