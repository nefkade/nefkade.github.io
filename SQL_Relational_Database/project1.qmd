The Lahman Baseball Dataset is a famous dataset when learning relational datasets.

I will be using SQLite3 in python to showcase SQL. This is only one of the enviroments that I am conforatble using SQL. The other is workbench.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import plotly.express as px
import sqlite3

sqlite_file = '../Data/lahmansbaseballdb.sqlite'
con = sqlite3.connect(sqlite_file)
```

```{python}
query = """
SELECT s.yearID
,      s.playerID
,      p.nameFirst || ' ' || p.nameLast AS name
,      s.salary
,      b.HR
,      b.RBI
,      b.AB
,      b.H
,      f.PO
,      f.A
,      f.E
,      f.G AS fielding_G,pi.W
,      pi.SO
,      pi.ERA
,      pi.G AS pitching_G

FROM Salaries s
LEFT JOIN Batting b ON s.playerID = b.playerID AND s.yearID = b.yearID
LEFT JOIN Fielding f ON s.playerID = f.playerID AND s.yearID = f.yearID
LEFT JOIN Pitching pi ON s.playerID = pi.playerID AND s.yearID = pi.yearID
JOIN People p ON s.playerID = p.playerID

WHERE s.salary IS NOT NULL
"""
df = pd.read_sql(query, con)
```
